ArDemo
=====

This repository contains Arduino and CAD files for two interactive demonstrations which have been shown to, and used by, children at:

* William Floyd Elementary School in Shirley, NY
* St. Mary's Hospital for Children in Bayside, NY

The two demos include a slave-master robotic arm setup using 3d-printed linkages, potentiometers, and servos; and an Adafruit Neopixel 60-LED board with a soft membrane potentiometer and pushbutton for different colors and brightnesses.
